Encrypted Messaging Software In A Network Environment Using Playfair Cipher With Turkish Alphabet

The objective of this project is to create a messaging software that encrypts messages in the server and decrypts them in the client, using Python. Since it is a Turkish version of a Playfair Cipher, we needed to make adjustments of our own. For example, a regular Playfair Cipher is a 5x5 matrix wheras our matrix is a 6x6 due to fact that Turkish alphabet is a 29 letter alphabet and the remaining 7 spots of that 6x6 matrix are filled with various punctuation marks such as “.” , “,” “!”, “?” etc.
